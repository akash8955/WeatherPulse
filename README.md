# WeatherPulse
🌦️ Weather Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

WeatherPulse is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes real-time weather data using a live Weather API.
It provides users with quick insights into current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure—helping with travel planning, daily decision-making, and environmental awareness.

🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Present real-time weather information in a clear and interactive format

Enable users to analyze weather conditions across different locations

Simplify weather data interpretation through intuitive visuals

🧰 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Main tool for creating interactive dashboards

🔄 Power Query – Used for API data extraction and transformation

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures and dynamic KPIs

🌐 Weather API – Real-time data source

🗃️ Data Modeling – Structured schema for efficient filtering and insights

📁 File Format – .pbix (Power BI project file)

📡 Data Source

Source: Public Weather API

The dataset includes real-time weather parameters such as:

City and country name

Current temperature

Minimum & maximum temperature

Humidity percentage

Wind speed and direction

Atmospheric pressure

Weather condition (clear, cloudy, rain, etc.)

Data is refreshed automatically using Power BI Service scheduled refresh.
